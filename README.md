<h1>Titanic survivors</h1>
<p>we are going to go through the popular Titanic dataset and try to predict whether a person survived the shipwreck.
 Dataset downloaded from Kaggle.</p>

<h4>The Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived or not. 0 for not surviving, 1 for surviving.</h4>

<p>we did some basic data analysis, then some feature engineering, and in the end-use some of the popular models for prediction. <p>
<p> Step 1: Importing basic libraries</p>
<p> Step 2: Reading the data</p>
<p> Step 3: Data Exploration</p>
<p> Step 4: Feature Engineering</p>
<p> Step 5: Data preprocessing for model</p>
<p> 1.	Drop the null values </p>
<p> 2.	Include only relevant data</p>
<p> 3.	Categorically transform all of the data, using something called a transformer.</p>
<p> 4.  data with the central tendencies for age and fare.</p>
<p> 5.  Normalize the fare column to have a more normal distribution. </p>
<p> 6.	using standard scaler scale data 0-1</p>
<p> Step 6: Model Deployment</p>

<h4>With Logistic regression model we obtained descent accuracy as 78 % </h4>
